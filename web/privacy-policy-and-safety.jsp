                or we may collect, <b>"Personal Data"</b> (i.e., information that can be used to identify you and which may also be 
                referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information”). Personal Data can include 
                information such as your name, email address, IP address, and device identifier, among other things. You are
                responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Data you submit to Mentoring. Inaccurate information may
