            <h3>Our License to You</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                Subject to these Terms and our policies (including the Acceptable Use Policy, Honor Code, 
                course-specific eligibility requirements, and other terms), we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive,

            <h3>Changes to Content Offerings</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                Mentoring offers courses and content ("Content Offerings") from universities and other providers ("Content Providers"). 
                While we seek to provide world-class Content Offerings from our Content Providers, unexpected events do occur. 
                Mentoring reserves the right to cancel, interrupt, reschedule, or modify any Content Offerings, or change the point value or weight
                of any assignment, quiz, or other assessment, either solely, or in accordance with Content Provider instructions.
                Content Offerings are subject to the Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability sections below.
            </p>
            <h3>No Academic Credit</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                Mentoring does not grant academic credit for the completion of Content Offerings. 
                Unless otherwise explicitly indicated by a credit-granting institution, participation in or completion of Content 
                Offerings does not confer any academic credit. Even if credit is awarded by one institution, 
                there is no presumption that other institutions will accept that credit. You agree not to accept credit for 
                completing a Content Offering unless you have earned a course certificate or other equivalent documentation of 
                your completion of the Content Offering. Mentoring, instructors, and the associated Content Providers have no 
                obligation to have Content Offerings recognized by any educational institution or accreditation organization.
            </p>
            <h3>Disclaimer of Student-Content Provider Relationship</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                Except as described in the Degree, MasterTrack, and University Certificate Programs section below, 
                nothing in these Terms or otherwise with respect to your participation in any Content Offerings by
                Content Providers : (a) establishes any relationship between you and any Content Provider; (b) enrolls or 
                registers you in any Content Provider institution, or in any Content Offering offered by any Content Provider 
                institution; or (c) entitles you to use the resources of any Content Provider institution beyond participation 
                in the Content Offering.

                Mentoring is committed to advancing the science of learning and teaching, and records of your participation in
                courses may be used for education research. In the interest of this research, you may be exposed to variations in 
                the Content Offerings. Research findings will typically be reported at the aggregate level. Your personal identity
                will not be publicly disclosed in any research findings without your express consent.

            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                Mentoring offers paid Services (e.g., course certificates for certain courses) for a fee. 
                Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. You are responsible for paying all fees charged by or 
                for Mentoring and applicable taxes in a timely manner with a payment mechanism associated with the applicable paid 
                Services. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees using other collection 
                mechanisms. Fees may vary based on your location and other factors, and Mentoring reserves the right to change any 
                fees at any time at its sole discretion. Any change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon 
                posting through the relevant Services. Refunds may be available for paid Services as described in our Refund Policy 
                below.

            <h3>Degree, MasterTrack, and University Certificate Programs</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                The Services may allow you to enroll in Degree, MasterTrack, and University Certificate programs or 
                similar programs offered by our Content Providers on the Mentoring platform. Our Content Providers serve as 
                the distance education providers of these programs and determine admissions, refund, and graduation or completion
                policies and requirements. Nothing in these Terms shall restrict the applicability to you of any institutional 
                policies established by our Content Provider in connection with these programs (e.g., student codes of conduct); 
                such policies shall supplement these Terms and to the extent there is a conflict between such policies and these 
                Terms, as between you and our Content Provider, our Content Provider’s policies shall govern.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                Depending on the program, tuition and fee payments for these programs may be collected by Mentoring or our 
                Content Partners. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we or our Content Partners may 
                collect tuition and fees using other collection mechanisms. Tuition and fees may vary based on your location and 
                other factors, and Mentoring and its Content Partners reserve the right to change any tuition and fees for 
                future semesters or equivalent payment periods at their sole discretion. Refunds may be available for paid 
                Services as described in our Refund Policy below. You are encouraged to research and consider whether the tuition
                and fees required for Content Offerings align with your professional and financial goals.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                Professional licensure, certification, and job requirements for various professions may vary in each state 
                and country, and job requirements may vary by employer. Mentoring does not guarantee licensure, certification 
                or qualification for any profession or job on the basis of your completion of a Content Offering on Mentoring. 
                You are advised to research, understand and comply with the requirements in the applicable state and/or country 
                in which you work or intend to work, and to investigate whether the Content Offering in which you intend to enroll 
                meets your academic and/or professional needs before enrolling.

            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functions, features, or requirements,
                and we may suspend (to the extent allowed by applicable law) or stop part of our Services altogether. Accordingly, Mentoring
                may terminate your use of any Service for any reason. If your use of a paid Service is terminated, a refund may be available
                under our Refund Policy. We may not be able to deliver the Services to certain regions or countries for various reasons, 
                including due to applicable export control requirements or internet access limitations and restrictions from governments.
                None of Mentoring, its Content Providers and instructors, its contributors, sponsors, and other business partners, 
                and their employees, contractors, and other agents (the "Mentoring Parties") shall have any liability to you for any such
                action. You can stop using our Services at any time, although we'll be sorry to see you go.
