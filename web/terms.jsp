                    <p style="font-size: 20px">
                        Mentoring offers courses and content ("Content Offerings") from universities and other providers ("Content Providers"). 
                        While we seek to provide world-class Content Offerings from our Content Providers, unexpected events do occur. 
                        Mentoring reserves the right to cancel, interrupt, reschedule, or modify any Content Offerings, or change the point value or weight
                        of any assignment, quiz, or other assessment, either solely, or in accordance with Content Provider instructions.
                        Content Offerings are subject to the Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability sections below.
                    </p>
                    <h3>No Academic Credit</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">
                        Mentoring does not grant academic credit for the completion of Content Offerings. 
                        Unless otherwise explicitly indicated by a credit-granting institution, participation in or completion of Content 
                        Offerings does not confer any academic credit. Even if credit is awarded by one institution, 
                        there is no presumption that other institutions will accept that credit. You agree not to accept credit for 
                        completing a Content Offering unless you have earned a course certificate or other equivalent documentation of 
                        your completion of the Content Offering. Mentoring, instructors, and the associated Content Providers have no 
                        obligation to have Content Offerings recognized by any educational institution or accreditation organization.
                    </p>

                        Except as described in the Degree, MasterTrack, and University Certificate Programs section below,

                        You and Mentoring agree to submit to binding arbitration any and all disputes, claims, or controversies of any 
                        kind, whether based on statute, regulation, constitution, common law, equity, or any other legal basis or theory, 
                        and whether pre-existing, present, or future, that arise out of or relate to our Services, these Terms, and/or any

                        or enforceability of these Terms and/or this arbitration provision, and (ii) relationships with third parties who
                        are not parties to these Terms or this arbitration provision to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law 
                        (each a “Claim,” and collectively the “Claims”).
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">
                        Any and all Claims shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the 
                        American Arbitration Association (the “AAA Rules”), as amended, in effect at the time arbitration is initiated. 
                        The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling (800) 778-7879, and are hereby incorporated by 
                        reference. In the event of any inconsistency between this arbitration provision and the AAA Rules, such inconsistency 
                        shall be resolved in favor of this provision. If you decide to initiate arbitration, you agree to pay the initiation 
                        fee of $200 (or the amount otherwise required by the AAA Rules), and we agree to pay the remaining arbitration 
                        initiation fee and any additional deposit required by AAA to initiate your arbitration. We will pay the costs of the 
                        arbitration proceeding, including the arbitrator’s fees; however, other fees, such as attorney’s fees and expenses of 
                        travel to the arbitration, shall be paid in accordance with the AAA Rules and applicable law. We will pay all costs 
                        associated with any arbitration that we commence. A single, neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA 
                        Rules shall decide all Claims.

                    <p style="font-size: 20px">
                        The arbitrator shall be an active member in good standing of the bar for any state in the continental United States and shall
                        be either actively engaged in the practice of law for at least five years or a retired judge. The arbitrator shall honor claims
                        of privilege recognized at law. Unless inconsistent with applicable law, and except as otherwise provided herein, each party
                        shall bear the expense of its respective attorney, expert, and witness fees, regardless of which party prevails in the 
                        arbitration. Any arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the federal judicial district of your residence, and you will
                        be given the opportunity to attend the proceeding and be heard. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding upon the 
                        parties and may be enforced in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitration shall be 
                        kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings,
                        briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed
